Implementation of Cooley-Tukey Algorithm for Fast Fourier Transform on GPU

This project was done as a part of Parallel Programming and Architectures course. 
I implemented Cooley-Tukey algorithm for Fast Fourier Transform using the CUDA platform in C language and optimized it using methods described in the paper [“High Performance Discrete Fourier Transforms on GPUs”](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.566.425&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
